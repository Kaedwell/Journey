# My Path into Software Engineering

Welcome to my learning archive!  
In June 2025, I decided to teach myself programming from scratch â€“ with the goal of building modern, scalable software that creates real-world impact.

This repository documents my journey: from the very first Python scripts to more complex projects involving AI, APIs, and user interfaces.

I'm not just sharing code here â€“ I'm sharing my thought process, mistakes, improvements, and everything that comes with seriously diving into tech.

## Why I'm doing this

Because I'm passionate about technology.  
Because I love challenges.  
And because I want to build solutions that matter â€“ maybe one day at a big tech company, maybe somewhere else. As long as it's meaningful work, I'm in.

## Project overview

- `01_hello_python/` â€“ basic print statements, variables, and just getting used to Python syntax
- `02_calculator_cli/` â€“ simple calculator using user input and functions â€“ where things started clicking
- `03_experiments/` â€“ random stuff I tried while learning (loops, ifs, bugs, frustration, joy â€“ all of it)
- `04_gui_calculator/` â€“ learning to build graphical interfaces using Tkinter
- `05_voice_calc_test/` â€“ early attempt at voice-controlled calculations (WIP)
- `06_openai_chatbot/` â€“ experimenting with OpenAI API and building a minimal chatbot (WIP)

## What's next

- Real-world data projects using Pandas, NumPy, and more  
- Web development with Python & JavaScript  
- Original ideas, coding challenges, and technical deep dives

Letâ€™s connect â€“ maybe now, maybe later in the industry. I'm in this for the long game.
