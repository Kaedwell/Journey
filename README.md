# Journey

# My Path into Software Engineering

Welcome to my learning archive!  
In June 2025, I decided to teach myself programming from scratch â€“ with the goal of building modern, scalable software that creates real-world impact.

This repository documents my journey: from the very first Python scripts to more complex projects involving AI, APIs, and user interfaces.

I'm not just sharing code here â€“ I'm sharing my thought process, mistakes, improvements, and everything that comes with seriously diving into tech.

## Why I'm doing this

Because I'm passionate about technology.  
Because I love challenges.  
And because I want to build solutions that matter â€“ maybe one day at a big tech company, maybe somewhere else. As long as it's meaningful work, I'm in.

## Project overview

- `01_calculator_cli/` â€“ my first Python script: a simple calculator
- `02_gui_calculator/` â€“ learning graphical interfaces (Tkinter)
- `03_voice_calculator/` â€“ early experiment with voice input
- `04_openai_chatbot/` â€“ first steps into AI and API integration (WIP)

## What's next

- Real-world data projects using Pandas, NumPy, and more  
- Web development with Python & JavaScript  
- Original ideas, coding challenges, and technical deep dives

Letâ€™s connect â€“ maybe now, maybe later in the industry. I'm in this for the long game.
